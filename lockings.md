## Introduction

You can use the `Locking` plugin to lock records for modifications on schedule defined for your team. The locking feature applies to users, who do not have the `team:calendar:override_date_lock` or `team:calendar:override_own_date_lock` access right in their role (such as regular users). Supervisors and higher managers, by default, can create and modify records even with the Locking plugin enabled, unless the `team:calendar:override_date_lock` is removed from their role.

Potential applications include a scenario when time entries must be ready by a specific moment for payroll processing, or something similar.

Note 1: The Locking plugin was developed to combat the possible modification of past records.

Note 2: In addition to locking the following situations make records non-editable.
If record is approved with the Report Approval plugin.
We consider such records finalized and prohibit edits. If a record must be edited, remove a condition that locks it.

## Locking Configuration Examples

- Monthly on the 1st at 8:15
```bash
15 8 1 * *
```
When the server time reaches 8:15 on the 1st day of any month, regular users will not be able to enter or modify any records for dates earlier than the first of this month.

- Weekly on Mondays at 10:00
```bash
0 10 * * 1
```
When the server time reaches 10:00 on a Monday, regular users will not be able to enter or modify any records for dates earlier than Monday.
- Biweekly
Unfortunately, cron format does not allow to specify every other week cut-off schedule. Use either monthly or weekly locking instead. If you really need a biweekly schedule, you have to customize Time Tracker, perhaps via a customization job.

## Date Range Is Locked Error

When users try to enter or modify records in a locked date interval, they see a Date range is locked error. Locking is not applied to users who have the `team:calendar:override_date_lock` or `team:calendar:override_own_date_lock` right.
