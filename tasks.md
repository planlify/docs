## Introduction

To track work time by tasks in addition to projects use the project and tasks tracking mode. You can set it on the `Team Settings` page.

To manage tasks use the Tasks tab in the Sidebar menu. This capability is available to users having the `team:template:create`, `team:template:read`, `team:template:update` and `team:template:delete` access right (default Co-manager, Manager, Top manager and Owner roles).

The Required checkbox on Configs is responsible for making a task selection mandatory on time entry and edit pages.

Use the Create button to create a new task. A screen like below appears. When adding a task you can select projects associated with it.
