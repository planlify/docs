## Introduction

To view `Charts`, you must activate the `Charts` plugin in the `Team settings` section `Plugins`.
Once you do it, a new tab called Charts appears in the `sidebar menu`. Use it to view various charts. They provide a visual breakdown of how work time is spent on different projects, tasks, or clients.

On the Charts page, you can:
- Select chart type to see time allocation for works/vacations/holidays/medicals. These are the options in the Chart dropdown control. To see clients there you must enable the -Clients plugin. For tasks to be available use projects and tasks tracking mode.
- Switch user to view charts for. To switch users, you need to have team:chart:view permission. Regular users can view their own data in charts and cannot select user.
- Select time interval for chart using the Interval selector and the date/calendar. Options in the Interval selector are relative to the selected date in the calendar.
