## Introduction
Application team features allow each registered user to create and belong to multiple teams.

- The Current Team ​
Every user in application has a "current team", if belongs to a team. This is the team that the user is actively viewing resources for. For example, if you are inserting data in a calendar, your application would display the calendar events for the user's current team.

- Switching Teams
A user may switch their current team via the "team switcher" menu available within the navigation bar.

- Member Management
Team members may be added and removed from a team via "Team Panel" section `Members`, must have permissions `team:users:view` and `team:user:create`.

- Invitations ​
For new member you have to send invitation emails to users that are invited to teams. If the user does not have an account, the invitation email can instruct them to create an account and accept the invitation. Or, if the user already has an account, they can accept or ignore the invitation.

Once you send user invitations, users that are invited to teams will receive an invitation email with a link to accept the team invitation. Users will not be full members of the team until the invitation is accepted.
