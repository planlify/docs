## Introduction

Application features allow teams to enter legal holidays, such as Christmas.
This tab is available in the `Team Panel` section `Holidays` where holidays can be inserted, if a holiday has more than one day, they can all be inserted, they have to be separated by ',' for example: 2023-12-24, 2023-12-25, 2023-12-26.
You have to select the users who benefit, this step is implemented because a company can have different legal holidays, for example, there are different holidays between regions in Germany and a company can have employees in two regions.
