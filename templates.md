## Required Input Parts

We use ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ designation to identify required input sections. They are 3 signs "stop signs" (aka "octagonal signs" Unicode U+1F6D1), in a row. If such fragments are used in template, users have to enter some data there before saving a record.
```bash
Call to: ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘
Type of service: ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘
Customer comments: ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘
```
With the example template body above, users need to provide input in 3 sections, such as so:
```bash
Call to: Mr. Musterman
Type of service: Instructions.
Customer comments: He clarified where I needed to go and everything went well.
```
Otherwise, Incorrect `Note` data error shows up
