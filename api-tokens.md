## Introduction

In the future, it will receive an update for developers, helping to take information and send via API to our Application.

Application includes first-party integration with Laravel Sanctum. Laravel Sanctum provides a featherweight authentication system for SPAs (single page applications), mobile applications, and simple, token-based APIs. Sanctum allows each user of your application to generate multiple API tokens for their account. These tokens may be granted abilities / permissions which specify which actions the tokens are allowed to perform.
