Each `team` has his own calendar, so if a user has more than one `team` than he are not allowed to read appointments from other team in current team calendar.
Certain days can be blocked for members who don't have the `team:calendar:override_date_lock` permission, which allows them to insert even if the date is blocked or you can use `Future Entries`, no one will be allowed to insert if the desired date is in the future. If necessary, you can activate the `Report approval` function in 'team settings'.
